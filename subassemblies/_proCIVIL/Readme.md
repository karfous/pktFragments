# subassemblies folder

Here you can find all the details about the subassemblies provided in pkt folder.

### What can I find here?

- detail versioning of each subassembly
- help with examples and dwg files
- ... what more?

## what is \_proCIVIL section

My previous project was hosted on www.proCIVIL.com domain but I made it deprecated. There was a lot of work done so I wanted to provide the subassemblies event in this new project.

### What about the structure and convention?

proCIVIL subassemblies can have different structure than subassemblies started in this pktFragments project. I will update them later, maybe :) - but maybe not.
