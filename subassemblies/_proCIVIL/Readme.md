# What is \_proCIVIL folder

www.proCIVIL.cz was my previous project during 2018 - 2021. Those days I worked as a road designer and I used Civil 3D for every day tasks.

I did not want to pay for a hosting provider so the website disapperared from the interner after while. I wanted the content to be still available so I restored all the subassemblies and uploaded them here for you. I will probably create help files in the future and translate them to English.

Be patient or help me with your fork :)

## What about the structure and convention in this project?

proCIVIL subassemblies can have different structure than subassemblies started in this pktFragments project. I am aware of it. Keep this in mind.
