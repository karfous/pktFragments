### How to combine with Subassembly composer conditions ?

1.  Create a custom condition subassembly in Subassembly composer (SAC) with a output parameter
2.  Reference the output to YesNoSwitch
3.  Set up desired output in YesNoSwitch to compare with referenced output from Subassembly composer
4.  following subassemblies will calculate itself only if YesNoSwitch parameter will be the same as calculate output parameter from SAC subassembly
