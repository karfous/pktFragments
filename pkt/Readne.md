# PKT folder

This folder contains all PKTs that were realesed in this repository.
You can easily download all subassemblies at once.

## Versioning example

LetÂ´s assume we have three subassemblies.

- Circle_2018_1.pkt (more update)
- Circle_2018_2.pkt (first release)
- Square_2018_1.pkt (first release)

Square has only one version that has already been released in the repository. It means that Square has not been repaired or updated since its first release.

Circle_2018_2.pkt is the second major version of Circle which is not compatible with the first major verison. We only have one release of second major version.

Circle_2018_1.pkt has already been updated several times. Minor fixes and some patches. We only have one pkt here in this folder because only major releases are important here.

## Want to have minor and patch version too?

See the detail folder of each subassembly for other releases.
